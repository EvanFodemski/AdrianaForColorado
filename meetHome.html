            <h2 class="earlylife">Early Life</h2>

            <p class="earlylifepar">At a young age, I was instilled with values of truth,
                honesty, principle, and integrity. My father, a judge,
                exemplified these qualities by never compromising for
                personal gain. He upheld principles and integrity in
                serving 'We the People' in Ecuador. Following my parents'
                divorce, my mother brought my sisters and I to America,
                where much of our family had already settled. I
                witnessed my mother face challenges, from learning
                English to supporting us as a single parent. Despite the
                difficulties, she persevered, teaching us to never give up.</p>

        <div class="row2z">
            <h2 class="marriedarmy">Married Life, Army Wife</h2>
            <p class="z2p1">I met my husband in my second year of college and we
                married a year later after he enlisted in the military. The
                financial struggles we encountered during those first
                years were quite challenging in Killeen, Texas, but we
                overcame by staying focused and working hard. At our
                second duty station, I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree
                double majoring in Finance and Economics at SUNY
                Oswego with high honors (Summa Cum Laude) while my
                husband became a Commissioned Officer through Officer
                Candidate School.</p>
            <p class="z2p2">
                It became clear to me that my dream to work on Wall
                Street as a Certified Financial Analyst would have to be
                put on hold due to our remote location and my husband's
                long-term obligations. With student loans to repay, I
                decided to apply as a substitute teacher. Surprisingly, I
                was presented with a special chance to teach Spanish at
                the nearby middle school under a critical needs
                certificate. While the hours and pay of a teacher may not
                be remarkable, the satisfaction of witnessing students
                actively participating, learning, and developing brought me
                immense happiness.

            <h2 class="depchild">Deployments and Children</h2>
            <p class="z3p1">
                Deployments can be unexpectedly challenging, and I
                encountered them two months after our daughter's birth
                when my husband was deployed to Iraq. This scenario
                repeated when our son turned one and on several occasions
                afterward. The support from the military community,
                neighbors, and church was invaluable in maintaining a
                sense of normalcy during my spouse's absence. However,
                attending numerous funerals on behalf of my husband at
                Fort Carson was an experience that deeply impacted me. It
                highlighted the selfless sacrifices made by our courageous
                servicemen and women in defense of our nation. Freedom
                is not free.

            <p class="z4p1">
                For years, I battled health issues that led to rheumatoid
                arthritis, causing severe joint pain. Simple tasks like using
                stairs became difficult. Visits to the Emergency Room
                were frequent due to numbness in my left arm and
                frequent heart palpitations. It was only after consulting a
                microbiologist that I discovered I had two strains of
                Lyme disease. Through the use of conventional medicine,
                and alternative treatments, I was able to recover. These
                challenging years taught me to rely on my faith, trust
                God, and find contentment in life's blessings.

            <h2 class="overseas">Overseas Assignments</h2>

            <p class="z5p1">
                The two consecutive assignments in Europe provided my
                family with the opportunity to explore various countries
                and gain a deeper understanding of the liberties that we
                may overlook in America. Educating our children through
                homeschooling during those formative years exposed them
                to the negative impacts of communism. They grasped the
                significance of the quote by George Santayana, "those who
                cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
                Our visits to numerous cemeteries allowed us to witness
                the countless gravestones honoring the sacrifices of our
                courageous men and women who fought for the freedoms
                we cherish today. We take great pride in being Americans.

            <p class="z6p1">
                How did Colorado become so expensive since we were
                last here? Feeling inspired to take action, I made a
                conscious effort to engage with the Republican Party
                members. As I delved deeper, I gained insights into the
                challenges facing our county and state. Encouraged to run
                for the position of county party secretary, I took on the
                role. Serving as secretary has allowed me to collaborate
                with dedicated volunteers and connect with numerous
                individuals across El Paso County. For the past three
                years, I have been actively walking and engaging with my
                district, attentively listening to the concerns of the
                people. I am running for Senate to be the voice you
                deserve in Denver, representing you with honesty,
                transparency, and values that resonate with yours.
