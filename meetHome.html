            <h1 class="meet1head"> Early Life</h1>
            <div class="meetpar11">
                At a young age, I was instilled with values of truth, honesty, principle, and integrity. My father,
                a judge, exemplified these qualities by never compromising for personal gain. He upheld principles
                and integrity in serving 'We the People' in Ecuador. Following my parents' divorce, my mother
                brought my sisters and I to America, where much of our family had already settled. I witnessed
                my mother face challenges, from learning English to supporting us as a single parent. Despite
                the difficulties, she persevered, teaching us that God always provides, even in the toughest
                times.

            <h1 class="meet2head">Married Life, Army Wife</h1>
            <div class="meetpar22">
                I met my husband in my second year of college and we married a year later after he enlisted
                in the military. The financial struggles we encountered during those first years were quite
                challenging in Killeen, Texas, but we overcame by staying focused and working hard. At our
                second duty station, I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree double majoring in Finance and
                Economics at SUNY Oswego with high honors (Summa Cum Laude) while my husband became a
                Commissioned Officer through Officer Candidate School.

                It became clear to me that my dream to work on Wall Street as a Certified Financial Analyst
                would have to be put on hold due to our remote location and my husband's long-term
                obligations. With student loans to repay, I decided to apply as a substitute teacher. Surprisingly,
                I was presented with a special chance to teach Spanish at the nearby middle school under a
                critical needs certificate. While the hours and pay of a teacher may not be remarkable, the
                satisfaction of witnessing students actively participating, learning, and developing brought me
                immense happiness.

            <div class="meetpar33">
                Deployments can be unexpectedly challenging, and I encountered them two months after our
                daughter's birth when my husband was deployed to Iraq. This scenario repeated when our son
                turned one and on several occasions afterward. The support from the military community,
                neighbors, and church was invaluable in maintaining a sense of normalcy during my spouse's
                absence. However, attending numerous funerals on behalf of my husband at Fort Carson was an
                experience that deeply impacted me. It highlighted the selfless sacrifices made by our courageous
                servicemen and women in defense of our nation. Freedom is not free.

            <div class="meetpar44">
                For years, I battled health issues that led to rheumatoid arthritis, causing severe joint pain.
                Simple tasks like using stairs became difficult. Visits to the Emergency Room were frequent due
                to numbness in my left arm and frequent heart palpitations. It was only after consulting a
                microbiologist that I discovered I had two strains of Lyme disease. Through the use of
                conventional medicine, and alternative treatments, I was able to recover. These challenging years
                taught me to rely on my faith, find contentment in life's blessings, and trust God.

            <div class="meetpar55">
                The two consecutive assignments in Europe provided my family with the opportunity to explore
                various countries and gain a deeper understanding of the liberties that we may overlook in
                America. Educating our children through homeschooling during those formative years exposed
                them to the negative impacts of communism. They grasped the significance of the quote by
                George Santayana, "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Our visits
                to numerous cemeteries allowed us to witness the countless gravestones honoring the sacrifices
                of our courageous men and women who fought for the freedoms we cherish today. We take
                great pride in being Americans.

                How did Colorado become so expensive since we were last here? Feeling inspired to take action,
                I made a conscious effort to engage with the Republican Party members. As I delved deeper, I
                gained insights into the challenges facing our county and state. Encouraged to run for the
                position of county party secretary, I took on the role. Serving as secretary has allowed me to
                collaborate with dedicated volunteers and connect with numerous individuals across El Paso
                County. For the past two years, I have been actively walking and engaging with my district,
                attentively listening to the concerns of the people. I am running for Senate to be the voice you
                deserve in Denver, representing you with honesty, transparency, and values that resonate with
                yours.
